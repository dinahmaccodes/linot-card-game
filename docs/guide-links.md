Research about this topic for me in relation to devlopment 

If necessary check development comments and fixes

the differences in how the queries and faucet work when doing local deployment in docker for linera v 0.15.5 or v 0.15.6 or v 0.15.7

I want to know the logic we are working with. How it works on the backend then how the contract connects to the graphql and then the graphql can be used to make queries on the frontend
Also how the whole flow works

Break it down for me so I can use another resource to research this graphql part especially. 

Also how lineras chain works when incoporationg multiplayer for local deployment 

Research online on how graph mutations work with the frontend for linera

I want you to use that to better understand how things work first 

I would recommend looking at this example to better understand event streams, microchess also uses events so you can check that out as well,
