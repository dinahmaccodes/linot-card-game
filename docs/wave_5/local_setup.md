This is the basics of how local deployment was working 

Current State: Your application works locally via 
run.bash
 and Docker compose with:

Local Linera network (linera net up)
Temporary storage (/tmp/linera_whot)
Multiple local wallets (wallet_1, wallet_2)
Local GraphQL services on ports 8081, 8082
Frontend on ports 5173, 5174
